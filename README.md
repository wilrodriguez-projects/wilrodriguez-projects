# Wil Rodriguez (Wil)

Hybrid builder + project leader focused on **Cloud, AI, and Ops Automation**.  
I build practical tools that connect **APIs + data + dashboards** and ship them with clear documentation.

## What I build
- **Automation + APIs:** Python services, integrations, operational tooling
- **Ops + Reliability:** incident workflows, runbooks, monitoring/alert concepts
- **Analytics:** Power BI dashboards & operational reporting
- **Project Delivery:** scope → plan → build → ship → support

## Current focus
- **AI-Powered Incident Copilot (Google Cloud)** — structured intake + faster triage + actionable summaries
- **Operational Dashboards** — cost, progress tracking, and decision support

## Featured projects
- 🔧 **AI-Powered Incident Copilot on Google Cloud** (in progress)
- 📊 **Cloud Migration Tracker + Governance Dashboard** (coming next)
- 🧩 **API Toolkit** — Postman collections + reusable request patterns (coming)

## Toolbox
